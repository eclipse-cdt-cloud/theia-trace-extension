# Theia Trace Extension UI test suite

The code in this directory constitutes a UI test suite, that's used to perform integration testing of the components of this repository, when used together in a Theia example application. It is not distributed as part of the various packages that get published to `npm`.

The content of this folder was bootstrapped from the generic [theia-playwright-template](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-playwright-template/tree/d30db090063f40d56b1b1687851385e8ea33b599) repository and adapted for use in this repository:

"This package uses the [Theia ðŸŽ­ Playwright](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/tree/master/examples/playwright) page object model for testing a [Theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia)-based application"
