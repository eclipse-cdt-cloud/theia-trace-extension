# License of Gitpod configuration files

The Gitpod config files have been copied from the main eclipse-theia repo, which is licensed like so:

This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the
terms of the Eclipse Public License v. 2.0 which is available at
https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0, or GNU General Public License, version 2
with the GNU Classpath Exception which is available at https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html.

Original files:

[.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/c1af83e93712e07049a4cfcf46735b039de24ab8/.gitpod.yml)

[.gitpod.dockerfile](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/c1af83e93712e07049a4cfcf46735b039de24ab8/.gitpod.dockerfile)

Note: The two above copied files are only useful for CI/tests and are not contributing to the Theia extension or example application contained in this repo. The presence of these differently licensed files in the repo would have no impact on the licensing of the Trace extension or the example application, that can both remain licensed under MIT.

(The MIT license permits re-licensing - that right remains available for anyone to exercise)
