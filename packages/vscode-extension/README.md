# Trace viewer vscode extension README

**Temporary configuration**:

What is under packages/vscode-extension will be moved to a separate repo and will be at the root of the repo

The trace viewer components, base and react-components, will be moved to their own repos. 

But it works, just run `yarn` and/or `yarn build` and then press `f5` from vscode (making sure the "Launch extension" configuration is selected).
