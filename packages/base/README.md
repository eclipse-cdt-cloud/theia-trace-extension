# Description

The Trace Viewer base package contains trace management utilities for managing traces using Trace Server applications that implement the Trace Server Protocol (TSP). While being initially used within the Theia Trace Viewer extension, its code base is independent to any Theia APIs and hence can be integrated in other web applications.
