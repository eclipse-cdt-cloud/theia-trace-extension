# Vulnerability Reporting Policy

If you think or suspect that you have discovered a new security vulnerability in this project, please __do not__ disclose it on GitHub, e.g. in an issue, a PR, or a discussion. Any such disclosure will be removed/deleted on sight, to promote orderly disclosure, as per the [Eclipse Foundation Vulnerability Reporting Policy][policy].

Instead, please report any potential vulnerability to the Eclipse Foundation [Security Team][security]. Make sure to provide a concise description of the issue, a CWE, and other supporting information.
