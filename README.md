# Trace Viewer extension for Theia applications

Theia trace viewer extension using the tsp-typescript-client (https://github.com/theia-ide/tsp-typescript-client) and Trace Server Protocol (https://github.com/theia-ide/trace-server-protocol).

Prerequisites for running this extension are the same as those for [running the theia IDE](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md#prerequisites).

‚ö†Ô∏è Apart from the live demo, both the application itself and its development environment only work on Linux operating systems. 

## Try a live demo via Gitpod!
Click the Gitpod button below to access a live demo of the trace viewer. In a couple clicks and around 2 minutes you'll be on your way.

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension)

Prerequisites: A GitHub account (for logging into Gitpod)

* Click [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension) to open Gitpod.
* After logging in, it takes around a minute for Gitpod to set up the in-browser IDE used to build the project.
* When the workspace has loaded, the project builds automatically in about a minute. Then, the workspace pops a notification saying a service (i.e. the tool) is now available.
![gitpod-service-ready-notification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/master/doc/images/gitpod-service-ready-notification-0.0.2.PNG)
* After opening the tool via the notification, the interface loads in a few seconds.
* Now you're ready to try the trace viewer!
    * Head to the trace viewer tab in the left side menu to get started.
    * The tool is loaded with the example traces from a set of [Trace Visualisation Labs](https://github.com/tuxology/tracevizlab). To analyse your own traces, [download the application](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension#download-the-application) for Linux.

![gitpod-live-demo-setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/master/doc/images/gitpod-live-demo-setup-0.0.2.gif)

## Download an external build of the application 
If you'd like to explore your own traces, you can **[download a Theia IDE build with this trace viewer extension here](https://www.dorsal.polymtl.ca/files/other/electron-theia-trace-example-app-0.0.1.AppImage)!**

* **Prerequisite: Java 11** (required since this tool reuses the [Eclipse Trace Compass server](https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass.incubator/trace-server/rcp/?d) which runs on Java)
   * If you get a confusing error "Error opening serial port ${this.port}. (Port busy)" when you try to run the app, it's likely that Java is missing.  
* **No compilation or additional downloads necessary!** Just change the AppImage file's permissions to make it executable (command: `chmod +x <filename>`) and run it.
* **For Linux systems only**

## Consume the trace viewer extension from npm

The **theia-trace-extension** project publishes the following packages to NPM:

* [theia-traceviewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/theia-traceviewer): The Theia trace viewer extension. Add this package to the package.json of your Theia application.
* [traceviewer-base](https://www.npmjs.com/package/traceviewer-base): This package contains trace management utilities for managing traces using Trace Server applications that implement the TSP.
* [traceviewer-react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/traceviewer-components): This package contains views and utilities for visualizing traces and logs via the TSP connected to a Trace Server application.

While being initially used within the *theia-traceviewer*, the code base of *traceviewer-base* and *traceviewer-react-components* is independent to any Theia APIs and hence can be integrated in other web applications.

## Build the extension and example application

Here is the step in order to build the trace viewer

1. Clone this theia-trace-extension repository
2. `cd theia-trace-extension`
3. Now you are ready to build the application: `yarn`

**Note for some debian-based machines**: On some distros, there are 2 yarn commands. If you get an error message saying **ERROR: There are no scenarios; must have at least one.**, you are using the wrong yarn. See [https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821).

You can also run two scripts to watch for changes and rebuild automatically:

1. From the root:

```sh
yarn tswatch # to compile TypeScript files
```

2. In parallel run:

```sh
cd examples/<browser or electron>
yarn watch # to update the frontend bundles (loaded by the browser)
```

## Try the trace extension

This repository contains an example trace-viewer application that includes the trace extension. It has two versions:

- _browser_: a "browser" application, accessed with a web browser
- _electron_: a native desktop application

You can find those example applications under `examples/`.

### Run the Trace Server

In order to open traces you need a trace server running on the same machine as the trace extension. You can download the [Eclipse Trace Compass server](https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass.incubator/trace-server/rcp/?d) or let `yarn` download and run it:

```bash
  $ yarn download:server
  $ yarn start:server
```

You can also build the trace-server yourself using Trace Compass and the Incubator, take a look at the [instructions here](https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/download.html#trace-server).

### Run the example app

From the repo root, run either

```bash
  $ yarn start:browser
```

And go to `http://localhost:3000`.

or

```bash
  $ yarn start:electron
```

And use the Electron application.

### Change the trace server URL

By default, the trace server is expected to be on responding at `http://localhost:8080/tsp/api`. If it is not the case, the URL can be changed using the `TRACE_SERVER_URL` environment variable when running the app.

For example, to start the browser example app with a specific URL, one can run

```bash
 $ TRACE_SERVER_URL=https://my.trace.server:port/tsp/api yarn start:browser
```

## Package the Example Theia Trace Viewer Application

It's possible to package the repo's example application with `electron-builder`. After running `yarn` in the repo root, do:

```bash
  $ cd examples/electron
  $ yarn package
```

  The configured Linux packaging(s) will be generated in folder `examples/electron/dist`

## Tests

To run tests once, at the root of the project do:

```shell
yarn test --verbose
```

To keep tests running do:

```shell
yarn test --verbose --watch
```

### Test coverage

The following command prints a coverage report to the terminal. As of now it covers all typescript files of the project, including those that are not supposed to have tests.

```shell
yarn test --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/**/*.ts'
```

## Using the trace extension
This section describes how to operate the Theia trace extension to view and analyze traces. The UI, view interactions, and UX are prelimiary and subject to revisions in the future.

![theia-trace-extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/master/doc/images/theia-trace-extension-0.0.2.png)

### Open a trace
To open a trace in the Theia Trace Extension, use the **File Explorer** in Theia to navigate to the trace directory. Then right-mouse click on the trace and select menu **Open With->Open Trace**.

![Open Trace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/master/doc/images/theia-trace-extension-open-traces-0.0.2.png)

If the selection is a single file, then the tool will open the file directly as a trace.

If the selection is a directory, then the tool will look for traces in **Common Trace Format (CTF)** format, such as **Linux Tracing Toolkit traces (LTTng)** Kernel and UST (Userspace) traces, and open all found CTF traces together under the same timeline. The trace events of each CTF trace will be analyzed in chronological order. With this you're able to open e.g. LTTng Kernel and UST Traces at the same time.

The example Trace Compass trace server above supports LTTng Kernel and UST traces. Example LTTng traces can be retrieved from the [Trace Compass Tutorials](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/tracevizlab). Just download the archive [TraceCompassTutorialTraces](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/tracevizlab/blob/master/labs/TraceCompassTutorialTraces.tgz), extract them into a local directory on your computer. They can also be automatically downloaded by running `yarn download:sample-traces` from the repository's root.

### Open the Trace Viewer
To open the **Trace Viewer**, select menu **View** from the top-level menu and then select **Trace Viewer** in the list of views. Then the **Trace Viewer** icon will be added on the left navbar, below the **File Explorer** Icon.

Select the **Trace Viewer** icon to switch to the trace viewer.

![Trace Viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/master/doc/images/theia-trace-extension-trace-explorer-0.0.2.png)

Now, you will see 3 sections: **Opened Traces**, **Available Views** and **Time Graph Tooltip**. Select the trace that you opened and the available views will be populated. Now you can select different views and they will be added into a single container view for that trace.

### Navigation and zooming
There is only a limited number of such operations and they are only implemented in the Time Graph views (the ones looking like Gantt charts). For Zoom-in/out use CTRL+mouse wheel. Or use left mouse drag on time axis on top. Navigating the trace you can use the scrollbar at the bottom of the trace timeline container.

### Time Graph Tooltip
Currently, the **Time Graph Tooltip** is populated when selecting a state in a Time Graph view.

## New contributors

### Explore the project context
* **Check out the [tracevizlabs](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/Tracevizlab).** You don't need to complete all of them, but reading a couple is good context. Lab sets 0 and 1 are especially useful.
* **Browse recent conference presentations.** They give an overview of the trace viewer's goals, architecture, and functionality.

* **Get an [overview of external components](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension#related-code)** used by this trace viewer. See how they interact.

### Start with a small change
* **Explore the [Gitpod demo](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension#try-a-live-demo-via-gitpod).** Experiment with the trace viewer. Start exploring its code via Gitpod's in-browser IDE.
* **Start with a small frontend improvement.** A relevant change can be [less than 5 lines of code](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/pull/369/files). The Theia-based frontend repo is much less complex than the Trace Server's, so by starting in the frontend you'll learn high-level context about the project's different components without being overwhelmed with complexity.
  * [Good first issues](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
  * _Develop with Gitpod to initially avoid dev setup._ Put `gitpod.io/#` before your project fork's github URL to open an in-browser IDE and initially avoid any local dev setup. This dev approach works best for small changes because Gitpod workspaces are volatile.
  * _Learn [how to contribute code](https://github.com/theia-ide/theia-trace-extension#how-to-contribute-code)._ Starting with a tiny change means you can first focus on exploring the code as well as learning the submission and review process (which is a significant learning step if you've never submitted a PR before).

## How to contribute code
**Changes to the project** are made by submitting code with a pull request (PR).
